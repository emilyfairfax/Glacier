# Glacier
Model for glacier profile with varying ELA and topography

<em>General Notes:</em>
<p>1) The codes in this repository work for both fluvial and linear topography. Good final version codes to run are the following: GlacierModelVaryingELAwithUValleyandExaggeratedErosion.m, GlacierwithIceTributaryversion2commented.m, and MultipleTributaries.m. Additionally there are some images of various model results uploaded to this repository.</p>
<p>2) The jpeg files show the end results of the ice tributary code with and without the tributary for easy comparison. Note the ice thicknening at x=1200 (marked by a dashed vertical line on the ice thickness plot) in the image of the glacier + ice tributary result. This is indicative of a subtle depression in the topography at that point, which is the step down in the stepwise glacial profiles as described in the Macgreggor Geology paper. </p>
